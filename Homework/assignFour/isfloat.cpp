Program name: "isfloat".  This is a single function distributed without accompanying software.  This function scans a      *
char array seeking to confirm that all characters in the array are in the range of ascii characters '0' .. '9'.  Further-  *
more, this function confirms that there is exactly one decimal point in the string.  IF both conditions are true then a    *
boolean true is returned, otherwise a boolean false is returned.  Copyright (C) 2020 Floyd Holliday                        *
